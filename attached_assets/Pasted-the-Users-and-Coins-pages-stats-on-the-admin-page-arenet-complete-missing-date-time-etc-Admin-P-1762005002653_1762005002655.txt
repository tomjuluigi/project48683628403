1:37:29 PM [vite] Pre-transform error: Failed to resolve import "next/router" from "client/src/pages/admin.tsx". Does the file exist?

The error occurs because admin.tsx is importing next/router, but this project uses wouter for routing, not Next.js. I can see from the code that the import statement is there but useRouter from Next.js isn't compatible with this setup.

Let me fix this by replacing the Next.js router import with the correct wouter import:

I'll help you fix both issues:

Fix the hide-coin error: The error shows that the hidden column doesn't exist in the coins table
Add platform logo badges for platform coins: Similar to how Zora SDK coins have category badges
Let me start by fixing the database schema and then update the UI.

1. Fix the hidden column error
First, let's add the hidden column to the coins table in the schema:

shared/schema.ts
+1
-0
Now create a migration file to add the column to the database:

supabase-add-hidden-column.sql
+2
-0
You'll need to run this SQL in your Supabase dashboard to add the column.

2. Add Platform Logo Badge for Platform Coins
Now let's update the coin card component to show a platform logo badge for platform coins:

client/src/components/coin-card.tsx
+23
-9
Now let's also update the home page to show platform badges on the pinned coins:

client/src/pages/home.tsx
+47
-10
We also need to import Sparkles icon in home.tsx:

Now update the admin panel to fix the hide/show coin mutations to use the correct field:

client/src/pages/admin.tsx
+5
-5
Now fix the admin routes to use address instead of ID:

server/routes/admin.ts
+10
-9
Now we need to add the updateCoinByAddress method to the storage class:

server/supabase-storage.ts
