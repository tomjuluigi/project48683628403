Thanks for the detailed follow-up. I now fully understand your question — you're **not** asking about the SDK, you're asking:

> Can developers use the **direct contract method** (`deploy()` or `deployCreatorCoin()`) to create coins on a **testnet**, especially **Base Sepolia**, using the ZoraFactory contract?

---

### ✅ Short Answer:

**Yes**, developers **can** use the contract method (i.e., `deploy()` or `deployCreatorCoin()`) to create coins on **Base Sepolia (chain ID 84532)** because the **ZoraFactory contract is deployed there** at the same address as mainnet.

---

### 🧠 How We Know:

From the documentation you shared and what’s publicly stated:

| **Chain**    | **Chain ID** | **ZoraFactory Address**                      |
| ------------ | ------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Base Mainnet | 8453         | `0x777777751622c0d3258f214F9DF38E35BF45baF3` |
| Base Sepolia | 84532        | `0x777777751622c0d3258f214F9DF38E35BF45baF3` |

> This means **the factory is deployed and functional on Base Sepolia**, which is Zora’s supported testnet for the coins protocol.

### 🧩 Contract Deployment Method Overview:

You can interact with the contract directly using:

* `deploy(...)` → for general coins ("content coins")
* `deployCreatorCoin(...)` → for official “creator coins”

These methods are:

* Available publicly via the ABI
* Accept standard parameters (payout recipient, URI, owners, symbol, etc.)
* Require a `poolConfig` (which determines how the coin will be paired, e.g., ETH, ZORA, etc.)

---

### ⚠️ Caveats (from the docs):

1. **Not all pool configurations are available on Base Sepolia.**

   * For example, `ZORA`, `CREATOR_COIN`, and `CREATOR_COIN_OR_ZORA` as currency types **are not supported** on Base Sepolia.
   * This mostly impacts what you can do in the `poolConfig`.

2. **You must provide a valid `poolConfig`.**

   * This is complex to construct manually.
   * Zora recommends using their internal (currently not public) **API endpoints** to generate these configs.

3. **You can use ETH or WETH as the backing currency** — this is safe and supported on Base Sepolia.

---

### 🔧 How to Use It on Testnet:

If you’re coding against the factory directly (not SDK), your flow looks like:

```solidity
IZoraFactory factory = IZoraFactory(FACTORY_ADDRESS); // same for Base Sepolia

(factory.deploy or factory.deployCreatorCoin)(
    payoutRecipient,
    owners[],
    uri,
    name,
    symbol,
    poolConfig,
    platformReferrer,
    // Optional: postDeployHook, postDeployHookData
    salt
);
```

You just need to:

* **Use a Base Sepolia RPC provider**
* **Ensure `chainId` is 84532**
* **Use test ETH on Base Sepolia**
* **Build or fetch a valid `poolConfig`** (manually or via internal Zora API, if you have access)

### 🧪 Want to test it?

You can deploy using Foundry/Hardhat or Remix with the correct ABI and parameters. Just make sure you're connected to Base Sepolia and funded with test ETH.
