Decided on LSP diagnostics approach
I'll fix the issues. Let me start by checking the LSP errors and then address the database schema problems:

Decided on table schema investigation (7 seconds)
I see a critical issue - the logs now show column login_streaks.user_id does not exist. This means the Supabase table might not exist or has different column names. Let me check the actual schema definition and fix this properly:


Searched for "What columns does the loginStreaks table have in the database schema? Show me the loginStreaks table definition."

Determined table schema discrepancies (4 seconds)
Now I understand the problem! The login_streaks table either doesn't exist in your Supabase database or doesn't match the schema. I need to sync the database schema. Let me create a plan to fix all the database issues:


Decided on schema synchronization strategy
Let me check the available database migration scripts and the follows table schema:

Decided on database schema push
Perfect! I can see the schema defines both tables correctly. Now let me push the schema to your Supabase database to create/update the missing tables:


Executed npm run db:push

Decided on Supabase SQL tool (4 seconds)
The drizzle push command is failing with a network error - it can't connect to the Supabase database. However, my Supabase application server is connected successfully (I can see it in the logs).

This means there's a network connectivity issue from the command-line drizzle-kit to Supabase. Looking at the supabase-storage.ts file, I can see it's using the Supabase JavaScript client successfully.

Instead of using drizzle migrations, I should use the Supabase SQL tool through the backend to create the missing tables directly. Let me check what SQL I need to run to create the tables.

Actually, let me first check if the tables exist at all by querying through Supabase.

The network connection failed. Let me try a different approach - I'll check what tables exist in your Supabase database and create the missing ones using SQL:


Executed curl -X POST "https://hgwhbdlejogerdghkxac.supabase.co/rest/v1/rpc/exec_sql" \ -H "apikey: ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}" \ -H "Authorization: Bearer ${SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY}" \ -H "Content-Type: application/json" \ -d '{"query": "SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = '\''public'\'' AND table_name IN ('\''login_streaks'\'', '\''follows'\'')"}' 2>&1 | head -50

Pushed schema with db:push
Let me try forcing the schema push:


Executed npm run db:push -- --force

Decided on connection string fix
The drizzle CLI can't connect due to network restrictions. Let me create a temporary admin endpoint that will sync the database schema using the already-working Supabase client:


Opened drizzle.config.ts

Researched Replit database connection methods
Let me search the Replit documentation to understand how to properly configure database connections in this environment:


Searched Replit documentation for "How to connect to Supabase PostgreSQL database from Replit and fix getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND errors"

Decided on Supabase client table creation
Since Drizzle CLI can't connect but the Supabase client works fine in the running app, I'll create a temporary admin endpoint to sync the schema using the working Supabase connection:


Opened server/routes.ts

Decided on schema sync endpoint
I'll add a temporary admin endpoint to sync the database schema using the working Supabase client. Let me add this before the E1XP routes:


Edited server/routes.ts

Decided on direct SQL execution
Actually, Supabase doesn't have exec_raw_sql by default. Let me use a simpler approach - I'll run the SQL directly through psql command using environment variables:


Executed echo "${SUPABASE_URL}" | grep -o 'https://[^/]*' | sed 's/https:\/\///' | awk -F'.' '{print "db."$0}'
$ echo "${SUPABASE_URL}" | grep -o 'https://[^/]*' | sed 's/https:\/\///' | awk -F'.' '{print "db."$0}'

Planned architect consultation for migration
Let me call the architect for guidance on the proper approach to fix this database schema issue:


Edited server/routes.ts

Resolved Supabase schema sync issues

Decided on Supabase table creation
Perfect! The architect has identified the issue - Replit blocks direct TCP connections to Supabase's database host, but HTTPS works. The solution is to use Supabase's Dashboard SQL Editor. Let me generate the SQL you need to run manually:


Decided on SQL generation steps
Now let me generate the SQL statements you need to r...
