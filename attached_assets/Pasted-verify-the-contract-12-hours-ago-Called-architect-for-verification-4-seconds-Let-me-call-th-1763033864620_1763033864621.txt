verify the contract

Called architect for verification (4 seconds)
Let me call the architect again to properly review the current implementation, as the UI code is actually present in the file:


Reviewed Registry tab implementation

Analyzed hook mock existence
The architect is saying there's a mock implementation. Let me check if there's a mocked hook somewhere that's overriding the real query:


Executed rg useRegistryStats client/src/pages/admin.tsx

Decided on registry stats query
Let me look at the actual query definition to see if there's any mocking:


Opened client/src/pages/admin.tsx

Decided on query verification status (4 seconds)
The implementation looks correct - the query IS using the real API endpoint. Let me now help you verify the contract on BaseScan as requested. Let me check the contract details first:


Verified API endpoint data source
You're right - let me investigate more carefully where mock data might be coming from. Let me check the queryClient configuration and the actual API response:


Opened client/src/lib/queryClient.ts

Decided on contract verification strategy (6 seconds)
Good - the queryClient configuration is correct. Now let's verify your contract on BaseScan. First, let me get the contract source code and constructor arguments:

Perfect! Here's how to verify your contract on BaseScan:

Contract Verification on BaseScan
Contract Details:

Address: 0x2ea259ccD2e983f9E635f138b28655d62127F6Bb
Network: Base Mainnet
Platform Wallet (constructor arg): 0xd657131eD517C53EAbAeb2F0ee66dE91c40eD74B
Method 1: Manual Verification on BaseScan
Go to https://basescan.org/address/0x2ea259ccD2e983f9E635f138b28655d62127F6Bb#code

Click "Verify and Publish"

Fill in the form:

Compiler Type: Solidity (Single file)
Compiler Version: v0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6
Open Source License Type: MIT License
Paste the contract source code (from contracts/CoinRegistry.sol)

Constructor Arguments ABI-encoded:

0x000000000000000000000000d657131ed517c53eabaeb2f0ee66de91c40ed74b

Submit for verification

Method 2: Using Hardhat (if Node version compatible)

Executed npx hardhat verify --network base 0x2ea259ccD2e983f9E635f138b28655d62127F6Bb 0xd657131eD517C53EAbAeb2F0ee66dE91c40eD74B

Decided on manual verification instructions
The Hardhat verify command isn't working due to Node.js version compatibility. Here's the complete manual verification guide:
