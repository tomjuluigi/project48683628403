Read befpre you start cpding 1. coin creation from Import url or upload is still mock 2. coin Preview modal is very big, it should be compact and the symbol of the coin must be automatcally be chosen by the system according to the channel/post/social account name/content name (users cant edit that) 3. Read this to undertand that e will be uaing testnet for now.

I've read through everything carefully. Let me confirm what I understand: ## **Current State & Requirements:** ### 1. **Coin Creation is Currently MOCK ❌** - The Import URL and Upload features are visible and functional for scraping/uploading - BUT the actual blockchain deployment in `content-preview.tsx` is mocked/fake - Users can go through the flow but no real coins are being created on-chain ### 2. **Coin Preview Modal Needs Changes 📐** **Current issues:** - Preview modal is too large - Users can edit the coin symbol manually **What you want:** - **Compact modal** - smaller, more efficient layout - **Auto-generated symbol** - System automatically creates symbol based on: - Channel name (for YouTube, etc.) - Social account name (for Twitter, Instagram, etc.) - Post/content name - Platform type - **Non-editable symbol** - Users cannot change the auto-generated symbol ### 3. **Base Sepolia Testnet Setup 🧪** From your attached docs, I now understand: **Testnet Details:** - **Chain:** Base Sepolia - **Chain ID:** 84532 - **Factory Address:** `0x777777751622c0d3258f214F9DF38E35BF45baF3` (same as mainnet) - **Supported:** `deploy()` and `deployCreatorCoin()` contract methods work - **Currency:** ETH-backed pools work, but ZORA-backed pools are NOT supported on testnet - **Pool Config:** Need to generate valid `poolConfig` for ETH-backed coins **Key Implementation Points:** - Use direct contract calls (already doing this in `zora-factory.ts`) - Deploy to Base Sepolia (84532) instead of Base mainnet (8453) - Use ETH as backing currency for testnet - Must provide valid `poolConfig` bytes --- **So the work ahead involves:** 1. Make coin creation REAL (not mock) - deploy actual coins to Base Sepolia 2. Redesign preview modal to be compact 3. Implement automatic symbol generation logic (no user editing) 4. Configure for Base Sepolia testnet with ETH-backed poolConfig Is this understanding correct before I proceed?

yes, pLeease do not work outusde the zora docs.

Decided on documentation source (4 seconds)
Understood! I'll work strictly within the Zora documentation. Let me search for the official Zora docs to understand how to properly configure ETH-backed coins on Base Sepolia testnet.


Searched the web for "Zora coins protocol Base Sepolia testnet pool configuration ETH backed"

Decided on Base Sepolia configuration (9 seconds)
Let me fetch the official Zora SDK documentation to understand how to properly create ETH-backed coins:


Decided on coin creation flow (5 seconds)
Perfect! I now have the official Zora documentation. Let me create a plan based on what needs to be done:


Decided on SDK integration approach
Let me start implementing these changes. First, let me check what packages are installed and mark the first task as in progress:


Decided on task completion status
Great! The SDK is already installed. Let me continue with the implementation:


Decided on data structure analysis
Now let me read the key files and implement the changes:


Decided on Zora SDK integration path (4 seconds)
Now let me implement the changes. I'll start by updating the zora-factory.ts file to use the Zora SDK properly for Base Sepolia with ETH backing, then update the preview component:


Created client/src/lib/zora-coins.ts

Planned SDK integration and symbol removal
Now let me update the content-preview component to use the real Zora SDK and remove symbol editing:


Edited client/src/components/content-preview.tsx

Marked tasks complete, planning next steps
Now let me update the task list and continue implementing the remaining changes:


Add coin software tools if needed
Optimized Agent memory

Decided on review and testing
Let me check the logs and verify the workflow is running properly:

Checked console and system logs

Called architect for review
Good! The application is running successfully. Let me restart the workflow to ensure all changes are applied, then call the architect to review the implementation:


Restarted Start application

Decided on workflow restart review
Now let me call the architect to review my implementation:


Reviewed Zora SDK integration for Base Sepolia

Decided on Zora integration approval
Perfect! The architect has reviewed and approved the implementation. Let me update the task list:

Documented implementation approved
✅ Implementation Complete!
I've successfully implemented the Zora SDK integration for Base Sepolia testnet, strictly following the official Zora documentation. Here's what was done:

Key Changes
1. Created client/src/lib/zora-coins.ts - New SDK wrapper that:

Uses official Zora SDK's createCoinCall() to generate transaction data
Deploys coins to Base Sepolia testnet (Chain ID 84532) with ETH backing (the only currency supported on testnet)
Extracts deployed coin addresses using getCoinCreateFromLogs()
Implements automatic symbol generation from platform/channel/account names
2. Updated client/src/components/content-preview.tsx:

Made the preview modal compact and clean (reduced from large to small card layout)
Removed symbol editing - symbols are now auto-generated and non-editable
Shows auto-generated symbol with a ✨ sparkle icon
Displays network info (Base Sepolia + ETH)
Full end-to-end flow: scrape → upload to IPFS → create DB record → deploy on-chain → update DB
3. Symbol Generation Logic:
Automatically creates ticker symbols in this priority order:

Author/channel name (e.g., "John Doe" → JD)
Username from URL (extracts @username from YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, Medium, etc.)
Title-based (multi-word → first letters, single-word → first 3-5 chars)
Platform fallback (e.g., YouTube → YT123)
Technical Details
Network: Base Sepolia (84532) - testnet environment
Currency: ETH-backed pools (ZORA/CREATOR_COIN not available on testnet per Zora docs)
Factory Contract: 0x777777751622c0d3258f214F9DF38E35BF45baF3 (same on all chains)
SDK Functions: createCoinCall(), getCoinCreateFromLogs(), CreateConstants.ContentCoinCurrencies.ETH
Architect Review Results ✅
The implementation was reviewed and approved:

✅ SDK integration follows official Zora documentation correctly
✅ Base Sepolia configuration is correct (chainId 84532, ETH currency)
✅ Symbol generation covers common platforms with good fallbacks
✅ No security issues observed
✅ Preview modal is now compact and user-friendly
Next Steps for Testing
To test coin creation on Base Sepolia:

Connect your wallet (must have Base Sepolia testnet selected)
Ensure you have testnet ETH (get from Base Sepolia faucet)
Import content via URL on the Create page
The platform will auto-generate the symbol and deploy the coin
The application is ready to test real coin deployments on Base Sepolia testnet! 🚀
